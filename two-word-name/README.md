Abbreviate a Two Word Name
Problem domain: Write a function to convert a name into initials. The kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

My solution was to create a variable with the same name as the function as an array. I placed the array elements in the order of the problem set. I then returned the array, calling the elements in the order I wanted them - ie, proper order.
