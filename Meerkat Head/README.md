My Head is at the Wrong End
Problem domain: An array function was given. The problems set was that the 3 elements head, body and tail were not in the proper order.

My solution was to create a variable with the same name as the function as an array. I placed the array elements in the order of the problem set. I then returned the array, calling the elements in the order I wanted them - ie, proper order.
